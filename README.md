Project Description

This project was done using Convolution neural network. In this project, we classify the 6 types of arrythymia by uploading an image and the trained model would display the result. The accuracy percentage obtained was 97.56. We have did this project in the form of a web page where we have used Flask framework to integrate our model and website. We have also deployed our model on IBM cloud.
